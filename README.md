# [Resume.MD](https://resume-md.vercel.app)

Hi there, this is simple React App to create and share resumes in markdown.

As any other CRA, `yarn install` and `yarn start` are enough to run the project on a local env.

This project pretends to be as simple as possible, that's why there's no testing or folder structure.

of course, PR's are absolutely welcome, any push on master branch will automatically deploy the build at Vercel.

This project only uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [@uiw/react-md-editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uiw/react-md-editor) so I think it can be a nice option to contribute if you're in your first steps with React. don't be shy!

Follow this steps to contribute:

    - Fork the repo
    - Create a new branch (fix/[name_of_fix] or feature/[name_of_feature])
    - PR your branch against the master branch

You can check the final result [here](https://resume-md.vercel.app)

And [here's](https://resume-md.vercel.app/carlostorres) my resume :D
